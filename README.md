<h1 align="center">
  <br>Data Base of a Dental CLinic (MongoDB)
</h1>

---
Challenge nÂº6 from the Fullstack Developer Bootcamp at <a href="https://geekshubsacademy.com/">GeeksHubs Academy</a>, where our mission is to create a backend no related database for a dental clinic application.

In this project, we have created as mentionned before, a dental clinic database that allows clients/users to create appointments and register them. These users can also choose the dentist from the collection "dentist" and add it to the collection "appointment". 

## The project is still in construction. ðŸ”§


Starting date: June 1st 2021. <br>
Due date: June 8th 2021.

We have used the Trello tool so we could share the tasks between the members of the project, in order to have a better organization.
